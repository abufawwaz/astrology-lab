    * NO VENUS Rx!
    * Good aspect Sun/Moon
    * Moon must NOT be void of course.
    * Moon MUST have good final aspect before going V.O.C.
    * Avoid Sun approaching square or opposition to Saturn.
    * NO MERCURY Rx!
    * Venus should apply to good aspect, or be applied to by Moon or Mercury. Avoid hard aspects from Venus to malefics.Avoid moon in Aries, Scorpio, or Capricorn.
    * Avoid Venus in Aries, Virgo, or Scorpio.
    * Good aspect Venus/Mars
    * Moon waxing (between New Moon and Full Moon) is best, but in my opinion, not as important as a good Moon/Sun aspect.
    * Good applying Saturn aspect

    * Ruler of 1st  MUST NOT be in hard aspect to ruler of 7th house
    * Keep malefics (Mars, Saturn, Uranus, Neptune, Pluto) out of 7th
    * Keep Uranus out of 7th and out of adverse aspect with ruler of 7th, Venus, or planet in 7th.
    * Moon in 7th house or angular; or, Moon applying to beneficial planet in 7th (avoid Moon in 6/12).
    * Keep malefics off angles if at all possible
    * Ascendant: no fewer than 3, no more than 27 degrees rising
    * Fixed Ascendant is desirable
    * Moon good aspect to rulers of 4th and 10th
